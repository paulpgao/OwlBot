# **HackRice OwlBot Project**
### Josie Garza, Alan Ji, Paul Gao, Kangrui Xue

We have created a reddit bot (track 1), named OwlBot, that performs several fun and practical functions:
- Provides Youtube and Spotify link to music or other videos when asked with keywords: *owlbot play*
- Provides a weather forecast for any "city, state" when asked with keywords: *owlbot what is the weather like in*
- Deciphers whether a photo contains an owl when asked with keywords: *owlbot, is this an owl?*
