# **HackRice OwlBot Project**
### Josie Garza, Alan Ji, Paul Gao, Kangrui Xue

We have created a reddit bot (track 1), named OwlBot, that performs several fun and practical functions:
- Provides Youtube and Spotify link to music or other videos when asked with keywords: "*owlbot play*"
- Provides a weather forecast for any city in the US when asked with keywords: "*owlbot, what is the weather like in*" followed by the "city, state"
- Deciphers whether a photo contains an owl when asked with keywords: "*owlbot, is this an owl?*" followed by a URL link (must be hyperlink: ends in .jpg, .png, etc.)
